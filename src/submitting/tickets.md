# Creating a Ticket

<br>

While working on a problem, you might have some issues that may need to be addressed. If you believe that something is unclear or there is an issue with the problem itself (wrong test cases, incorrect problem statement/samples, etc.), look for the “Report an issue” button at the bottom of the problem page.

Once here, you will be able to submit a ticket regarding your concern for the problem. Please remember to title your ticket and preview it before creating!
