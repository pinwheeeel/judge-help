# Viewing All/Best Problem Submissions

<hr>

On the sidebar of the problem page, you may view other submissions by other users by pressing **All submissions** or have a sorted list of the best submission of each user by clicking **Best Submissions**. On the all/best submissions page, you may also view your own past submissions by clicking the **Mine** tab on the top right of the screen.

{: .important}
You will only see general submission information such as judge verdict or code execution time/memory, but **<u>you will not be able to view any submission code UNLESS you have fully solved the problem AND are not within a contest</u>**. You may however view any of your previous submissions with these buttons at any time.
